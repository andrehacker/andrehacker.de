I am a software developer interested in data science, parallel data processing, databases, and probably too many other things.

Whatever I work on, the user comes first.

## Projects
* I worked for the [Stratosphere](http://stratosphere.eu/) Big Data Analytics platform as a student research assistent at TU-Berlin. I contributed the [Accumulators](http://stratosphere.eu/docs/0.4/programming_guides/java.html#accumulators) feature.
* In my BSc [thesis](http://www.andrehacker.de/cv/thesis-andre-hacker-printed-20131105.pdf#page=4) I implemented a machine learning algorithm and evaluated Stratosphere and Hadoop, qualitatively and by benchmarking. The code and lots of logistic regression related stuff is on [github](https://github.com/andrehacker/logreg).
* [Food Browser](https://github.com/andrehacker/tea) ([Live Demo](http://foodbrowser-andrehacker.rhcloud.com/)) is a small visualization project to browse through the world of food statistics. It arose from my interest in tea. Uses JavaScript and google charts on the client side and has two backend implementations (REST JSON), with node.js and postgres and with Java Spring MVC and MongoDB.
* [MinimalNote](https://github.com/andrehacker/minimalnote) is a note-taking app, designed to be fast and keyboard-optimized. Uses C++11, Qt and sqlite.
* From 2005 to 2009 I was founder and CTO of [syncing.net](http://syncing.net). Think of it as a Dropbox-like software to share files and MS Outlook data. We were VC funded by [HTGF](http://www.high-tech-gruenderfonds.de/) and [ZFHN](http://zf-hn.de/).
