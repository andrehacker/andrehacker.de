I am a software developer interested in data science, parallel data processing, databases, and probably too many other things.

## Projects
* I worked for the [Stratosphere](http://stratosphere.eu/) open source Big Data Analytics platform as a student research assistent at TU-Berlin. One of my contributions is the [Accumulators](http://stratosphere.eu/docs/0.4/programming_guides/java.html#accumulators) feature.
* In my BSc [thesis](http://www.andrehacker.de/cv/thesis-andre-hacker-printed-20131105.pdf#page=4) I implemented a machine learning algorithm and evaluated Stratosphere and Hadoop, qualitatively and by benchmarking. The code and lots of logistic regression related stuff is on [github](https://github.com/andrehacker/logreg).
* [Food Browser](http://foodbrowser-andrehacker.rhcloud.com/) ([github](https://github.com/andrehacker/tea)) is a small visualization project to browse through the world of food statistics, i.e. to get a feeling for the things you eat and drink. It arose from my interest in tea. Uses JavaScript and google charts on the client side and has two backend implementations (REST JSON), with Spring MVC and MongoDB and with node.js and postgres.
* [MinimalNote](https://github.com/andrehacker/minimalnote) is a note-taking app, designed to be fast and keyboard-optimized. Uses C++11, Qt and sqlite.
* From 2005 to 2009 I was founder and CTO of [syncing.net](http://syncing.net). Think of it as a Dropbox-like software to share files and MS Outlook data. We were VC funded by [HTGF](http://www.high-tech-gruenderfonds.de/) and [ZFHN](http://zf-hn.de/).
